# Smart Daily Expense Tracker

## üì± App Overview
Smart Daily Expense Tracker is an Android app built with **Jetpack Compose** and **MVVM architecture** for small business owners to quickly log, view, and analyze daily expenses. It includes multi‚Äëscreen navigation for expense entry, listings, and visual reports with charts, plus user‚Äëfriendly features like category chips, live totals, and date picking.

## ü§ñ AI Usage Summary
Development followed an **AI‚ÄëFirst** approach using ChatGPT for architecture planning, navigation fixes, UI layout generation, and troubleshooting build/runtime errors. GitHub Copilot assisted with boilerplate Compose code, ViewModel patterns, and form validation routines. AI tools also helped resolve Gradle dependency issues, refactor navigation from type‚Äësafe serialization to string routes, and improve UX design patterns efficiently.
